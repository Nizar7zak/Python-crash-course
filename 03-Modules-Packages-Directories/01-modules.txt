What is a module?

  instead of write my all code in one file
  I can write each function in specific file
  and i can call it when I want

note / create a module and import it in another file


what about package?
packages are basically another way to organize our code.

its about put all files related to each other in 
one directory and we can import it any time.

let's see how!

after that lets talk about random package.
.random
.randint
.choice

now we will create a dice roll game  to get number from 1 o 6
two time.



# now let's work with pathlib package,
# absolute path 
c:\Program Files\Microsoft

# relative path


pathlib.path('')
pathlib.exist() => true or false
pathlib.mkdir('new_path')
pathlib.rmdir('new_path')
pathlib.glob('*.py')
